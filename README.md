# SBRG
A renormalization group (RG) procedure on qubit Hamiltonians that is similar to the Spectrum Bifurcation Renormalization Group (SBRG) developed by You, Qi, and Xu in [Phys. Rev. B 93, 104205](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03635). I never ended up using this much for research, so it is somewhat incomplete and untested!
